This is a project that was assigned to me during my Designing and Using Databases class.
It includes 10 queries in a movie database.Each one of them is described with a comment above it.

All of them produce the right results since they were checked by a script that validates whether they are right or wrong.

This is a picture link that shows the schema for this database.
